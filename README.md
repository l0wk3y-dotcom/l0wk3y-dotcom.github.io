### Adding Pages and Blog Posts

To add content to your site, follow these steps:

1. **Markdown vs. HTML**: Write your content in Markdown (.md) for easier formatting. [Here's a quick guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) if you need to learn Markdown in 5 minutes.

2. **Page URLs**: Your pages will be available under `https://<yourusername>.github.io/<pagename>`. For example, a file named `about.md` will be at `https://<yourusername>.github.io/about`.

3. **Blog Posts**: Use the `_posts` directory for blog entries, following the format `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md`. You can delete the sample posts once you add your own.

4. **YAML Front Matter**: Customize each page using YAML front matter. Example:
   ```yaml
